Description: This package provides interactive functions in the form of a shiny application to explore a shotgun metagenomic dataset from a paired study of sorbitol intolerant c57BL/6J mice before and after treatment. Sorbitol intolerance was induced using a combination of the broad spectrum antibiotic streptomycin and a high fat diet, 'western-style' diet.
